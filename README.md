# MNIST KNN Model

This is project trains a K Nearest Neighbors Classifier model using the MNIST Numbers dataset. MNIST dataset is a vast collection of handwritten digits (0 to 9). It contains more than 60,000 entries. This dataset is often used for quickly training and testing machine learning models.

K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier is used for non-parametric classification. It is commonly known as KNN. In KNN, weights are assigned to each neighbors of the given node. The nearer nodes contribute more to the average when compared with the more distant ones.

The model trained in this project utilizes a minature version of the MNIST dataset for faster training & testing phases. The data size used is 19999 entries from the MNIST dataset. A train-test split ratio of 0.8 is used for optimal training. 

The model successfully achieved an accuracy of over **95%** over the testing data, thus, highlighting the classification capabilities of the K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm
